## Image Classification with PyTorch
PyTorch, one of the newer Python-focused frameworks for designing deep learning workflows that can be easily productionized.  
PyTorch is one of many frameworks that have been designed for this purpose and work well with Python, among popular ones like TensorFlow and Keras. It also offers strong support for GPUs.

we will build an image classification model,which will help to understand the shape of an image and the distribution of classes.   
to prepare data for optimum modeling results and then build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will classify images.

### Why Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)?
why we need CNNs in the first place and how they are helpful???  
**We can consider Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, as feature extractors that help to extract features from images.**  
1- This is the problem with artificial neural networks â€“ they lose spatial orientation.
### Large number of parameters
Another problem with neural networks is the large number of parameters.  
these parameters will only increase as we increase the number of hidden layers. So, the two major disadvantages of using artificial neural networks are:  
**Loses spatial orientation of the image  
The number of parameters increases drastically**   
So how do we deal with this problem? How can we preserve the spatial orientation as well as reduce the learnable parameters?  
This is where convolutional neural networks can be really helpful. CNNs help to extract features from the images which may be helpful
in classifying the objects in that image. It starts by extracting low dimensional features (like edges) from the image, and then some high dimensional features like the shapes.

**We use filters to extract features from the images and Pooling techniques to reduce the number of learnable parameters.**  
### Brief to Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs  

![image](https://github.com/E008001/Simple-Image-Classification-Model/blob/master/CNNarchitec.jpg)  

A CNN is primarily a stack of layers of convolutions, often interleaved with normalization and activation layers.(a 2d Convolution Layer is an multiplication between the input and the different filters, where filters and inputs are 2d matrices) The components of a convolutional neural network is:   
CNN A stack of convolution layers  
Convolution Layer  A layer to detect certain features. Has a specific number of channels.  
Channels  Detects a specific feature in the image.  
Kernel/Filter  The feature to be detected in each channel. It has a fixed size, usually 3 x 3.  
  
![image](https://github.com/E008001/Simple-Image-Classification-Model/blob/master/element-wise.jpg)  
```
first_conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
```
We use the Conv2d layer because our image data is two dimensional.  
**in_channels**:The value of in_channels equal to the number of channels in the layer above or in the case of the first layer, the number of channels in the data.  
**out_channels**: is the dimensionalityof the output space(the number of output filters in the convolution) larger number of out_channels allows the layer to potentially learn more useful features about the input data but the size of your CNN is a function of the number of in_channels/out_channels in each layer of your network and the number of layers. If you have a limited dataset, then you should aim to have a smaller network so that it can extract useful features from the data without overfitting.
**kernel_size** is the size of the filter that is run over the images.  
The **stride** argument indicates how far the filter is moved after each computation.  
The **padding** argument indicates how much 0 padding is added to the edges of the data during computation.  
### Pooling  layerts  
Maxpool Layers (2x2 filter) is about taking the maximum element of a small (2x2) square that we delimitate from the input

### Importing Library  
To begin, import the **torch** and **torchvision** frameworks and their libraries with **numpy**, **pandas**, and **sklearn**. Libraries and functions used in the code below include:
transforms, for basic image transformations
**torch.nn.functional**, which contains useful activation functions
Dataset and Dataloader, PyTorch's data loading utility

```
```
train_img = []
for img_name in tqdm(train['Image_Name']):
    # defining the image path
    image_path =  str(img_name) + '.JPG'
    
    # reading the image
    img = imread(image_path, as_gray=True )
    img = resize(img, (img.shape[0] // 8, img.shape[1] // 8))
                      
    # normalizing the pixel values
    img /= 255.0
    # converting the type of pixel to float 32
    img = img.astype('float32')
    # appending the image into the list
    train_img.append(img)
    ```
    
    ```
    # converting the list to numpy array
train_x = np.array(train_img)
# defining the target
train_y = train['Lable'].values
train_x.shape
```
#### Creating a validation set 
we use 20% data in the validation set and the remaining in the training set.
```
train_x, val_x, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(train_x, train_y, test_size = 0.2)
(train_x.shape, train_y.shape), (val_x.shape, val_y.shape)

**convert the images and the targets into torch format**:
```
# converting training images into torch format
train_x = train_x.reshape(16, 1, 28, 28)
train_x  = torch.from_numpy(train_x)

# converting the target into torch format
train_y = train_y.astype(int);
train_y = torch.from_numpy(train_y)

# shape of training data
train_x.shape, train_y.shape
```
convert the validation images:
```
# converting validation images into torch format
val_x = val_x.reshape(6000, 1, 28, 28)
val_x  = torch.from_numpy(val_x)
# converting the target into torch format
val_y = val_y.astype(int);
val_y = torch.from_numpy(val_y)
# shape of validation data
val_x.shape, val_y.shape
```


### Defining the Model Structure  
use a simple CNN architecture with 2 convolutional layers to extract features from the images.
then using a fully connected dense layer to classify those features into their categories.
```
class Net(Module):   
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.cnn_layers = Sequential(
            # Defining a 2D convolution layer
            Conv2d(1, 4, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
            BatchNorm2d(4),
            ReLU(inplace=True),
            MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            # Defining another 2D convolution layer
            Conv2d(4, 4, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
            BatchNorm2d(4),
            ReLU(inplace=True),
            MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
        )

        self.linear_layers = Sequential(
            Linear(4 * 7 * 7, 10)
        )

    # Defining the forward pass    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.cnn_layers(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.linear_layers(x)
        return x
```
define the optimizer and the loss function for the model:
```
	# defining the model
	model = Net()
	# defining the optimizer
	optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.07)
	# defining the loss function
	criterion = CrossEntropyLoss()
	# checking if GPU is available
	if torch.cuda.is_available():
	    model = model.cuda()
	    criterion = criterion.cuda()
	   
	print(model)
```
